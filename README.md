#ApartmentHub - Python/Kivy

A prototype for an organizational tool for my two other roommates and me, totally rehauled in HTML/CSS/JS at this link: https://github.com/GusVieweg/ApartmentHubHTML.  I was fascinated with the Kivy library so I figured I could build a neat touchscreen application using it, but was slowly overcome by its complexity as well as it rigidity.  However, it did help me solidify OOP concepts I was struggling with and I am happy to provide it as a resource for future Kivy projects.
